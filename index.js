SET
A Set is a very useful data structure to know for solving algorithm problems â€” any time you need to keep track of a list of unique values, it's a good data structure to consider! In our case, it's a bit more straightforward to use than an object, since an object is really meant for storing key-value pairs, and all we really care about are the keys. Here's how we can use a Set:

function hasTargetSum(array, target) {
  const seenNumbers = new Set(); // initialize an empty Set
  for (const number of array) {
    const complement = target - number;

    // .has returns true if the Set includes the complement
    if (seenNumbers.has(complement)) return true;

    // .add adds the number to the Set
    seenNumbers.add(number);
  }
  return false;
}*/
